Frequency-Map-Based Artificial Intelligence (FM-AI) Design

Abstract

The Frequency-Map-Based Artificial Intelligence (FM-AI) represents a novel, white-box AI paradigm for pattern recognition and generative tasks. Unlike traditional neural networks, FM-AI eschews gradient-based optimization in favor of structured frequency mapping of input data. This approach enables transparent computation, high interpretability, and adaptive learning from heterogeneous datasets, including visual and textual information.

1. Core Principles

FM-AI is founded on the principle that complex patterns can emerge from the statistical analysis of frequency distributions. Inputs are represented as frequency maps, which capture positional, relational, and contextual data. Processing occurs via computational layers of interconnected frequency maps, producing outputs derived from observed statistical correlations rather than learned weights.

Key characteristics include:

White-box design: all computational steps are interpretable and modifiable.

Cumulative learning: frequency maps are incrementally refined with new data.

High precision: numeric values within maps can be scaled to capture subtle patterns.

2. Architecture

2.1 Input Layer

Receives indexed input data as frequency maps.

Supports multiple modalities:

Pixel position frequency maps — spatial distribution of features.

Pixel color frequency maps — statistical occurrence of colors at each position.

Neighbor color frequency maps — local spatial correlations.

Textual frequency maps — words, phrases, and semantic context.


Values are numerically represented (0–100,000) and normalized to percentages for internal calculations.


2.2 Hidden Layer

Composed of multiple frequency maps that interact to propagate information.

Functions analogously to a neural network hidden layer but relies solely on frequency-based calculations.

Supports configurable parameters, enabling adaptive sensitivity to input patterns.

Facilitates the creation of child maps for hybridized pattern detection.


2.3 Output Layer

Produces actionable outputs, such as generative images, predicted states, or control signals.

Derived from cumulative frequency interactions across the hidden layer.

3. Custom Reference Maps

Users can create custom frequency maps from labeled datasets, specifying objects, shapes, actions, or poses.

Custom maps serve as reference bias for generation or decision-making.

Child maps can combine multiple custom maps to form hybrid representations, enhancing generalization and pattern recognition.



---

4. Textual Processing

Textual frequency maps encode linguistic structures and semantic relationships.

Word relationship sub-maps model word order and syntactic dependencies.

Enables prompt-to-image or text-to-action generation, where semantic context guides pattern selection and mapping in other modalities.



---

5. Learning Mechanism

FM-AI incrementally updates frequency maps based on observed data distributions.

Child maps inherit traits from multiple parent maps, allowing emergent recognition of hidden patterns.

Adjustable numeric range allows precision tuning, which directly impacts pattern detection fidelity.



---

6. Features

Multimodal learning: integrates visual and textual information.

White-box transparency: all operations and map states are accessible for inspection or modification.

Customizable precision: numeric scale configurable for subtle or coarse pattern detection.

Cumulative learning with hybridization: child maps synthesize multiple parent maps to capture complex patterns.

Feedback loop support: can implement artificial self-awareness via recursive analysis of outputs.

7. Advantages

1. Interpretability: Unlike traditional deep neural networks, all internal operations are transparent.


2. Flexibility: Supports multiple input types and custom reference data.


3. Incremental learning: Can continuously improve from new data without retraining from scratch.


4. Biologically inspired: Conceptually mirrors natural adaptive learning and reflective reasoning.


5. Customizability: Users can influence bias through labeled reference maps and precision tuning.

8. Limitations

Computationally intensive at high precision with large datasets.

Lacks traditional backpropagation; may require manual configuration for certain complex tasks.

Artificial self-awareness is limited to feedback loops; not equivalent to consciousness.

9. Applications

Image generation from pixel art datasets or textual prompts.

Game AI capable of decision-making and adaptive learning.

Pattern recognition in structured or semi-structured data.

Educational tools demonstrating interpretable AI mechanisms.

10. Summary

The FM-AI design represents a novel, interpretable, and flexible AI paradigm. By leveraging frequency mapping across visual, textual, and custom reference data, FM-AI achieves adaptive pattern recognition and generative capabilities without traditional gradient-based learning. Its modular and transparent architecture facilitates research, experimentation, and practical applications in both offline and interactive domains.
